This project implements a way to identify the contents of files, streams,
and similar constructs made up of bytes, such that the category of the
file format (archive, image, video, audio, etc.) and the specific file
format (wave, jpeg, png, mpeg) can be retrieved.

Repository and project location: [CodePlex][1]  
Maintainer: [Lasse V. Karlsen][2]

**NOTE**: This code is still very, *very*, much in flux. Do not use this
in anything remotely related to production code. Expect methods to gain
new parameters, be overloaded, or to disappear completely.
